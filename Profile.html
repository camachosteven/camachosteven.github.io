    <li><p>Hello, my name is as written above and this is my first ever portfolio website.
       I've worked extra hard to get this website running as nice and good-looking as possible
        despite the fact that I don't have any graphic design or photographic experience. This is the big, final
        project each student had at Wyncamp.

     <li class="skill-info" id="info1">I have been playing piano for 2 years now.
     I began learning from my teacher/mentor Marcelo Yepez, who was an excellent pianist
   and who taught me most of the things I know.</li>
     <li class="skill-info">Piano is a passion so special and different to me compared to other
   passions I have. I enjoy math, programming, and speedcubing. However, in the back of my mind, I know I must work to specialize
 in those things because they all go towards having a successful career. When I play piano, it's as if I lost myself in the instrument and
 whether I'm playing something difficult or easy, I just enjoy worshipping God with any song I'm playing.

     JavaScript, and Ruby languages. All except Ruby are primarily front-end languages, while
   Ruby works mostly in the back-end.</li>
      <li class="skill-info">I have really enjoyed learning code and creating different and
      dynamic projects such as this portfolio site. I really hope that I can specialize and master this skill
    in college by studying computer science as well as participate in any internship or part-time job I can obtain.
    I've been thinking about taking the full Wyncode bootcamp after high school and before college starts in the fall.
    That's how fascinated I've been in programming. I'd also prefer to learn much more objectt-oriented programming in addition
  to front-end development.</li>
